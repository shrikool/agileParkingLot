There are four type of references in java
1. Soft Reference :: They are only collected when the memory is going to be full, even if the referrant is weakly
   reachable, they are kept for some time.
2. Weak Reference :: They are collected eagerly by the jvm if the referrent is weakly reachable than they are collected
3. Phantom Reference :: They are something you need to study, open the class Phantom Reference.java in the java.lang
    .ref package.
4. Strong Reference :: This are just normal reference.


Every stuff here is related with the garbage collection
Need to study more about the garbage collection
